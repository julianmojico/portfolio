Played around with some textures (dress, hair, gloves and shoes).
Tested different brushes for shadow and lights, giving deep of field.
Finally search for the right color scheme, applied some filters, blurness and masked the scene with a centered circle to finish the cartoonish layout.

Isn't she stunning?
